      <p>Our webpage allows users to search the database of the top 6000 songs of all time.</p>

<p>Users can search songs by typing an artist or title into the search bar, typing a range of rankings into the ranking textfield, and a range of years into the year range textfield. If no information is provided, then it executes a default search.</p>

<p>After making a search, the number of songs found is displayed above the table.
The user can click a song title to open a YouTube search for that title in a new window.
If the user clicks on the artist, the link will take him to the Wikipedia page for that artist.</p>

<p>The user can click on the link 'Macallan's Top 20' songs to see his personal top 20 songs in the database.
Likewise, clicking on the link 'Tom's Top 10' will display Tom's personal top 10 songs in the database.</p>

<p>Finally, the About page has information about where we got the database from.</p>

<p>Features we didn't have time to implement, but wish we had.
     We would like to have the option of displaying more visually pleasing results view.
     This might include album covers for the songs, playing the songs in our own page instead of YouTube link, or links to buy the songs in iTunes.</p>
