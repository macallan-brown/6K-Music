        Our webpage allows users to search the database of the top 6000 songs of all time.
        
        <br>Users can search songs by typing an artist or title into the search bar, typing a range of rankings into the ranking textfield, and a range of years into the year range textfield.
        <br>If no information is provided, then it executes a default search.

        <br>After making a search, the number of songs found is displayed above the table.
        <br>The user can click a song title to open a YouTube search for that title in a new window.
        <br>If the user clicks on the artist, the link will take him to the Wikipedia page for that artist.
        
        <br>The user can click on the link 'Macallan's Top 20' songs to see his personal top 20 songs in the database.
        <br>Likewise, clicking on the link 'Tom's Top 10' will display Tom's personal top 10 songs in the database.
        
        <br>Finally, the About page has information about where we got the database from.

        <br> We would like to have the option of displaying more visually pleasing results view.
        <br> This might include album covers for the songs, playing the songs in our own page instead of YouTube link, or links to buy the songs in iTunes.
