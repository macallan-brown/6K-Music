If no information is provided, then it executes a default search.\r\n\r\nAfter making a search, the number of songs found is displayed above the table.\r\nThe user can click a song title to open a YouTube search for that title in a new window.\r\nIf the user clicks on the artist, the link will take him to the Wikipedia page for that artist.\r\n        \r\nThe user can click on the link 'Macallan's Top 20' songs to see his personal top 20 songs in the database.\r\nLikewise, clicking on the link 'Tom's Top 10' will display Tom's personal top 10 songs in the database.\r\n        \r\nFinally, the About page has information about where we got the database from.\r\n        \r\nCitation for our database.\r\nName of the data set: 'Top6000Songs.xls'\r\nLink to the page: http://www.acclaimedmusic.net\r\nLink to download the data set: http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/top_6000_songs_150822.xls\r\n\r\nLicense information: It is posted publicly for anybody to see and use. There is nothing that says it is licensed.\r\n        \r\nFeatures we didn't have time to implement, but wish we had.\r\n     We would like to have the option of displaying more visually pleasing results view.\r\n     This might include album covers for the songs, playing the songs in our own page instead of YouTube link, or links to buy the songs in iTunes.\r\n        \r\n",
